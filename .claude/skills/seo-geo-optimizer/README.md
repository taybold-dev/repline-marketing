# SEO/GEO/AEO Optimizer

Analysis and optimization toolkit for content visibility across search engines (SEO), AI platforms (GEO - Generative Engine Optimization), answer engines (AEO - Answer Engine Optimization), voice assistants, and social media.

**Author**: Boris Djordjevic, [199 Biotechnologies](https://199.bio)
**Status**: Phase 2 Complete (Content Implementation)
**License**: MIT
**Repository**: [github.com/199-biotechnologies/claude-skill-seo-geo-optimizer](https://github.com/199-biotechnologies/claude-skill-seo-geo-optimizer)

## Purpose

This skill audits and optimizes content for discoverability across:

- **Search engines**: Google, Bing, Brave Search (traditional SEO)
- **AI platforms**: ChatGPT (Search, Atlas browser), Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, Brave Leo (GEO - Generative Engine Optimization)
- **Answer engines**: Google AI Overviews (Gemini 3, default Jan 2026), Google AI Mode (separate citation surface), Bing Copilot, featured snippets (AEO - Answer Engine Optimization)
- **Voice assistants**: Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa
- **Social media**: Facebook, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon

Supports HTML, Markdown, and React/JSX files.

## What Shifted (Nov 2025 → May 2026)

- **Google AI Overviews swapped to Gemini 3 on 27 Jan 2026.** ~42% of previously cited domains were replaced; ~88% of AI Overview answers now cite 3+ sources (SE Ranking).
- **Google AI Mode is a separate citation surface from AI Overviews** — URL overlap ~14%. It uses query fan-out, so each H2 needs to stand alone as an answerable sub-query.
- **Google retired FAQ rich results in Search on 7 May 2026.** FAQ schema still earns its place for non-Google engines and as a structural signal for AI platforms.
- **ChatGPT's 7 May 2026 update gave referral links more prominence.** Similarweb measured a step-change in traffic and ~60% of it now lands on brand homepages — make the homepage answer "what does this site do" cleanly.
- **schema.org v30.0 (19 Mar 2026)** added `Credential` and `Error`; deprecated `Attorney` in favour of `LegalService`.
- **Schema-as-a-GEO-lever has been demoted.** An Ahrefs test of 1,885 pages found ~+2.4% AI-Mode citation lift from adding JSON-LD — noise. Keep schema for entity / rich-result purposes; pair it with original data.
- **llms.txt** is now a Lighthouse 13.3 "Agentic Browsing" audit, but no major AI crawler consumes it in production (as of May 2026). Useful for agent-facing developer docs; not a citation lever.

See `reference/statistics-2026.md` for sources and the full review pass.

## Installation

Clone to Claude skills directory:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/
git clone https://github.com/199-biotechnologies/claude-skill-seo-geo-optimizer.git
```

Requirements: Python 3.7+, no external dependencies (stdlib only).

Verify installation:
```bash
python ~/.claude/skills/seo-geo-optimizer/scripts/analyze_content.py --help
```

---

## Usage

### Phase 1: Analysis

Audit existing content, generate recommendations:

```bash
# Comprehensive audit with all reports
python scripts/audit_report.py ~/project/page.html --format all

# Analyze specific aspects
python scripts/analyze_content.py ~/project/page.html
python scripts/metadata_validator.py ~/project/page.html
python scripts/keyword_analyzer.py ~/project/page.html
python scripts/entity_extractor.py ~/project/page.html
```

### Phase 2: Implementation

Apply optimizations automatically:

```bash
# Full optimization pipeline for specific platform
python scripts/auto_implementer.py page.html perplexity

# Individual optimization steps
python scripts/content_optimizer.py page.html
python scripts/platform_optimizer.py page.html chatgpt
python scripts/voice_optimizer.py page.html
python scripts/freshness_monitor.py page.html
python scripts/citation_enhancer.py page.html
```

### Keyword Clustering

Group related keywords into semantic clusters for topical authority:

```bash
# Analyze with keyword clusters (default)
python scripts/keyword_analyzer.py ~/project/page.html

# Fast mode without clustering
python scripts/keyword_analyzer.py ~/project/page.html --no-clusters
```

Output includes:
- Semantic clusters grouped by TF-IDF similarity
- Topic identification for each cluster
- Recommendations for pillar content strategy

### IndexNow Instant Indexing

Submit URLs directly to search engines for immediate indexing (critical for GEO/AEO):

```bash
# Generate IndexNow key
python scripts/indexnow_submit.py --generate-key --output ./public

# Submit single URL
python scripts/indexnow_submit.py https://example.com/new-page --key YOUR_KEY

# Batch submit from file
python scripts/indexnow_submit.py --batch urls.txt --key YOUR_KEY
```

Benefits for GEO:
- Bing index feeds AI platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude)
- Fresh content indexed in minutes vs weeks
- Fresh content (<30 days old) is reliably preferred by Perplexity and the post-Gemini-3 AI Overviews

### Generate Schema Markup

```bash
# FAQ schema (highest AI citation probability)
python scripts/schema_generator.py faq \
  --question "What is longevity medicine?" \
  --answer "Longevity medicine optimizes biomarkers like LDL <70 mg/dL to reduce cardiovascular risk by 30-40%."

# Article schema with E-E-A-T signals
python scripts/schema_generator.py article \
  --title "Understanding Biomarkers" \
  --author "Dr. Sarah Johnson" \
  --credentials "MD, PhD" \
  --date "2025-01-15"
```

## Features

### Content Analysis

**File Types**:
- HTML (`.html`)
- Markdown (`.md`, `.mdx`)
- React/JSX (`.jsx`, `.tsx`)

**Extraction**:
- Meta tags (title, description, keywords)
- Open Graph (og:title, og:description, og:image)
- Twitter Cards (twitter:card, twitter:title)

### Keyword Analysis

Five keyword types extracted:

1. **Primary**: Main topic (H1, meta title, URL, first 100 words)
2. **Semantic**: Related terms (H2/H3, body)
3. **LSI**: Co-occurring terms (natural language)
4. **Long-tail**: 3-8 word phrases (FAQ, H3)
5. **Question**: Who/what/where/when/why/how (FAQ schema)

**Keyword Clustering**: TF-IDF + cosine similarity groups keywords into semantic clusters for topical authority and pillar content strategy.

### Schema Generation

JSON-LD schemas with validation:

- **FAQPage**: Highest AI citation probability

## Research Foundation

The Princeton / Georgia Tech "Generative Engine Optimization" tactics
(statistics addition, named-authority quotation, fluency, citing
sources, authoritative phrasing) have held up across the 2026
follow-up work — notably AgenticGEO (arXiv) and the "Citation
Selection vs Absorption" study. Specific percentage lifts from the
original paper are kept off this README on purpose: the 2026 studies
couldn't reproduce them, even though the direction of each tactic
still holds.

What the 2026 studies did add:
- Position bias is strong — material in the first ~30% of a page
  picks up a disproportionate share of AI citations (iPullRank).
- Perplexity selects at the passage / sub-document level, not the
  page level (366k-citation arXiv study, July 2025).
- Schema-as-a-GEO-lever was overstated — Ahrefs measured ~+2.4%
  AI Mode lift from adding JSON-LD across 1,885 pages.
- Brave Search visibility correlates with Claude citation more
  closely than Google ranking does.

For sourced numbers and what changed in the last six months, see
`reference/statistics-2026.md`.
- Featured snippets: 40.7% of voice answers

Platform citation patterns:
- ChatGPT: Wikipedia (1.3M citations), G2 (196K), Forbes (181K)
- Perplexity: Update frequency critical (passage-level retrieval prefers fresh sections)
- Claude: 91.2% correct source attribution (Q2 2025)
- AI Overviews: 13.14% of queries (March 2025), up from 6.49% (January 2025)
